# Iris-Classification

The Iris dataset is a commonly used dataset in machine learning for classification tasks. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each belonging to one of three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica.

# Confusion Matrix:
# Diagonal Elements:

* Higher values on the diagonal are good; they represent correct predictions.
* Look for big numbers on the main diagonal.
# Off-diagonal Elements:

* These indicate misclassifications.
* Check which classes are often confused with each other.
# Accuracy Plot:
# Increasing Line:

* A line going up means the model is learning and getting better.
# Fluctuations:

* If the line wiggles a lot, it might mean the model is struggling.
# Plateau or Going Down:

* If the line flattens or goes down, there might be issues.
* It could be overfitting or the model needs more complexity.
# Overall:
# Look for Patterns:

* Check if there are specific classes causing confusion.
* Understand if the model is consistently improving or encountering problems.
# Adjust if Needed:

* If things don't look good, consider adjusting how the model learns (learning rate, epochs) or the model itself (complexity).
# Check Data:

* Ensure your data is prepared well. Maybe some features need more attention.
